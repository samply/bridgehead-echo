# Bridgehead Echo

For testing and monitoring [Beam](https://github.com/samply/beam) and [Beam-Connect](https://github.com/samply/beam-connect) connectivity, a [Bridgehead](https://github.com/samply/bridgehead) might opt to run this small, internal "echo" tool.

It's just a very [minimal static html server](https://github.com/lipanski/docker-static-website) (under MIT License), serving a simple HTML page in around 160KB.
